Following are the pre-requistes for this program to work properly
This is tested to work on Ubuntu 10.04 (32bit)

1) sudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall yasm texi2html libfaac-dev libmp3lame-dev libopencore-amrnb-dev libopencore-amrwb-dev libsdl1.2-dev libtheora-dev libvorbis-dev libvpx-dev libx11-dev libxfixes-dev libxvidcore-dev zlib1g-dev


Install ffmpeg compiled with libx264 support using
2) sudo dpkg -i ffmpeg_4:SVN-r25329-1_i386.deb

Incase (2) fails then follow the instructions on

Making sure the dynamic linker run-time bindings are configured
3) sudo ldconfig

Alternatively you can run the "install" program from commandline which would 
perform steps 1,2,3 for you.

Run the GUI program using 
4) ./gui 

If you want this to be invoked from everywhere then copy "gui" to /usr/bin
